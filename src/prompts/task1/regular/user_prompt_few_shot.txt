The following sample corresponds to a physiological signal represented through symbolic sequences.

Available diagnosis are:
- "Brady"
- "Normal"
- "Tachy"

Follow the steps below:
1. Take your time and think carefully about patterns that distinguish each class:
	•	Brady: 4–7 peaks (<60 bpm)
	•	Normal: 8–11 peaks (60–100 bpm)
	•	Tachy: 12–18 peaks (>100 bpm)

To help you find the correct answer, we additionally provide you with other samples together with their label.
Here are the example samples:

2. Now have a detailed look at the sample that is provided below. Take a deep breath and compare what it to the features you learned about.

Sample: {sequence}

3. Finally, generate an output regarding your final thoughts. Respond in the following JSON format:

{{
  "Narrow_peaks": <number>,
  "Wide_peaks": <number>,
  "Total_peaks": <number>,
  "Label": "Brady" | "Normal" | "Tachy"
}}
